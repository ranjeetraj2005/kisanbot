# Where is your MQTT server running? 99% of setups will use the same value

# If your server is on a domain (eg=my-own-farmbot.com), put it here.

# DONT USE `0.0.0.0`.
# Use a real ip or domain name.

# If you wish to opt out of https:// (we wish you wouldn't), you can

# Let's Encrypt.
FORCE_SSL=Remove this if not using HTTPS://
