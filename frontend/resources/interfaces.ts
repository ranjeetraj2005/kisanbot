   * PROBLEM: _efficiently_ tracking variable declarations across all sequences.

   * USE CASE:
   *  * You have a sequence `Sequence.0.1`
   *  * It has 2 variables: `parent` and `parent1`.
   *
   * SOLUTION:
   *  * Create an index entry, indexed by UUID, for every variable declared in
   *    a sequence.
   *   * Within that entry, map the name of the var to a map of meta attrs.
   *

   * PROBLEM:

   * DISAMBIGUATION:
   *  * If resource deletion can cause a referential integrity error, it is said
   *    to be "in use"
   *  * Another way to think of the term "in use": "Can't be safely deleted"
   * SCENARION:
   *  * A sequence (`Sequence.0.1`) has 2 "consumers":
   *    * A FarmEvent that triggers it (UUID: "FarmEvent.0.2")
   *    * A Sequence ("Sequence.0.3") that calls the sequence ("Sequence.0.1")
   *      via an `execute` block.
   * SOLUTION:
   *  * Create an index (tracked by UUID), for every resource that is "inUse".
   *  * If it does not have an entry, it's not in use and can safely be deleted.
